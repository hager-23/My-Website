                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Having a bachelor's degree in English literature, I have been giving online private lectures since 2020, owing to the fact that I am specialized in analyzing literary works, such as novels and drama, following several literary theories. I believe that literature is of great importance in the sense that when students become emotionally involved, they are motivated, and this, in turn, contributes to their personal development.</p>
                <p>Additionally, being an English instructor, I have found modern teaching methods extremely valuable to my field, therefore taking CELTA-based training to enhance my skills as a teacher to assist young learners was remarkably significant in helping me create effective lesson plans.</p>
                <p>Apart from that, I have been trained to be an IELTS instructor under the supervision of knowledgeable teachers, two of whom are Laila Akhnoukh, a former IELTS examiner and a current IELTS instructor at AUC and Mohamed Ibrahim, the owner of E-Plus School and an IELTS expert.</p>
